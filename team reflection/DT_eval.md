### Teamwork Reflection

One of the teamwork principles that our team was able to implement particularly effectively was having competent team members whose skills can significantly contribute to achieving team goals. Yue and I had skillsets that complemented each other well; Yue had extensive knowledge of building and deploying our microservice, while I was well-versed in writing the python code for ETL and formatting the html files. These skillsets allowed us to work efficiently and problem-solve effectively. Another teamwork principle that we were strong at was establishing a collborative working climate, which was easy to do considering we were already friends prior to the project. This made it very comfortable for us to provide constructive criticism on each other's work; if one person's work was lacking in a certain department, there were no reservations on expressing this from the other person. It is very important for members of a team to maintain open minds on how they can improve their work, because this truly maximizes the results of the final product.
